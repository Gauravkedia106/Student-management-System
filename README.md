# Student-management-System
Overview:

This is a repository of  student management system, which implies a software application for managing information related to students.
Functionality:

The system is capable of:
Collecting data from users: This suggests that users, likely administrators or staff, can input or provide information regarding students.
Storing data in a database: The collected information is stored systematically in a database, ensuring structured and organized data storage.

Website Operations:

CRUD Operations on the website: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This indicates that users can perform these fundamental operations on the data stored in the system through a web interface.
Backend Technologies:

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):

Used for connecting the Java application to a SQL database.
This connection facilitates the transfer of data between the Java application and the database.
Servlets:

Used for fetching data from users or displaying data to them.
Servlets are server-side components that handle HTTP requests, making it possible to manage interactions between the frontend (user interface) and the backend (server and database).
Frontend Technologies:

HTML and Bootstrap:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for structuring the content on web pages.
Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides pre-designed components and styles, contributing to a visually appealing and responsive user interface.


In summary, this student management system allows users to input and manage student data through a web interface, with the backend using JDBC for database connectivity and servlets for data interaction. The frontend is developed using HTML and Bootstrap to ensure an effective and user-friendly experience.
